It\n\t     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is\n\t     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling\n\t     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n\t     * thought.\n\t     *\n\t     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n\t     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n\t     * following ways.\n\t     *\n\t     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n\t     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n\t     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n\t     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n\t     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n\t     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n\t     * be left uncaught.\n\t     *\n\t     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n\t     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n\t     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n\t     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n\t     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n\t     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n\t     *\n\t     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n\t     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n\t     * up all resources that an Observable used.

When the output function\n\t     * is called with arguments it will return an Observable. If function `func`\n\t     * calls its callback with one argument the Observable will emit that value.\n\t     * If on the other hand the callback is called with multiple values the resulting\n\t     * Observable will emit an array with said values as arguments.\n\t     *\n\t     * It is very important to remember that input function `func` is not called\n\t     * when the output function is, but rather when the Observable returned by the output\n\t     * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes an AJAX request, that request\n\t     * will be made every time someone subscribes to the resulting Observable, but not before.\n\t     *\n\t     * Optionally, a selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. The selector function\n\t     * takes the same arguments as the callback and returns the value that will be emitted by the Observable.\n\t     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as an array\n\t     * the selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as the callback would.\n\t     * This means you can imagine the default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n\t     * as a function that aggregates all its arguments into an array, or simply returns first argument\n\t     * if there is only one.\n\t     *\n\t     * The last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when the call\n\t     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n\t     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default, the subscription to  an Observable calls `func`\n\t     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as the last parameter will defer the call to `func`,\n\t     * just like wrapping the call in `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0` would. If you use the async Scheduler\n\t     * and call `subscribe` on the output Observable all function calls that are currently executing\n\t     * will end before `func` is invoked.\n\t     *\n\t     * By default results passed to the callback are emitted immediately after `func` invokes the callback.\n\t     * In particular, if the callback is called synchronously the subscription of the resulting Observable\n\t     * will call the `next` function synchronously as well.  If you want to defer that call,\n\t     * you may use `Scheduler.async` just as before.  This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can\n\t     * ensure that `func` always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n\t     *\n\t     * Note that the Observable created by the output function will always emit a single value\n\t     * and then complete immediately. If `func` calls the callback multiple times, values from subsequent\n\t     * calls will not appear in the stream. If you need to listen for multiple calls,\n\t     *  you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n\t     *\n\t     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property) and is not already bound the context of `func`\n\t     * will be the context that the output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n\t     * is called as a method of some objec and if `func` is not already bound, in order to preserve the context\n\t     * it is recommended that the context of the output function is set to that object as well.\n\t     *\n\t     * If the input function calls its callback in the \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n\t     * optional error parameter signaling whether the call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n\t     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n\t     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions the same as any other and error parameters\n\t     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n\t     *\n\t     *\n\t     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\n\t     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n\t     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n\t     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n\t     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n\t     *\n\t     *\n\t     * @example <caption>Receive an array of arguments passed to a callback</caption>\n\t     * someFunction((a, b, c) => {\n\t     *   console.log(a);

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n\t     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n\t     * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,\n\t     * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling\n\t     * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means\n\t     * something went wrong.\n\t     *\n\t     * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same\n\t     * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output\n\t     * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.\n\t     * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will\n\t     * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit\n\t     * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),\n\t     * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.\n\t     *\n\t     * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to\n\t     * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular\n\t     * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but\n\t     * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.\n\t     *\n\t     * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,\n\t     * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to\n\t     * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n\t     * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler\n\t     * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n\t     * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n\t     * Scheduler works exactly the same.\n\t     *\n\t     * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n\t     * of returned function, when it is called.\n\t     *\n\t     * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n\t     * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n\t     * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n\t     * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n\t     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n\t     *\n\t     * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n\t     * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n\t     * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n\t     * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n\t     *\n\t     * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n\t     * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n\t     * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n\t     * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n\t     * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n\t     * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when\n\t     * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you\n\t     * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,\n\t     * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.\n\t     *\n\t     * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value\n\t     * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable or in selector function.\n\t     *\n\t     *\n\t     * @example <caption>Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable</caption>\n\t     * import * as fs from 'fs';\n\t     * var readFileAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);\n\t     * var result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');\n\t     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n\t     *\n\t     *\n\t     * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback with multiple arguments</caption>\n\t     * someFunction((err, a, b) => {\n\t     *   console.log(err); // null\n\t     *   console.log(a); // 5\n\t     *   console.log(b); // \"some string\"\n\t     * });\n\t     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n\t     * boundSomeFunction()\n\t     * .subscribe(value => {\n\t     *   console.log(value); // [5, \"some string\"]\n\t     * });\n\t     *\n\t     *\n\t     * @example <caption>Use with selector function</caption>\n\t     * someFunction((err, a, b) => {\n\t     *   console.log(err); // undefined\n\t     *   console.log(a); // \"abc\"\n\t     *   console.log(b); // \"DEF\"\n\t     * });\n\t     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction, (a, b) => a + b);\n\t     * boundSomeFunction()\n\t     * .subscribe(value => {\n\t     *   console.log(value); // \"abcDEF\"\n\t     * });\n\t     *\n\t     *\n\t     * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback in regular style</caption>\n\t     * someFunction(a => {\n\t     *   console.log(a); // 5\n\t     * });\n\t     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n\t     * boundSomeFunction()\n\t     * .subscribe(\n\t     *   value => {}             // never gets called\n\t     *   err => console.log(err) // 5\n\t     *);\n\t     *\n\t     *\n\t     * @see {@link bindCallback}\n\t     * @see {@link from}\n\t     * @see {@link fromPromise}\n\t     *\n\t     * @param {function} func Function with a Node.js-style callback as the last parameter.\n\t     * @param {function} [selector] A function which takes the arguments from the\n\t     * callback and maps those to a value to emit on the output Observable.\n\t     * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] The scheduler on which to schedule the\n\t     * callbacks.\n\t     * @return {function(...params: *): Observable} A function which returns the\n\t     * Observable that delivers the same values the Node.js callback would\n\t     * deliver.\n\t     * @static true\n\t     * @name bindNodeCallback\n\t     * @owner Observable\n\t     */\n\t    BoundNodeCallbackObservable.create = function (func, selector, scheduler) {\n\t        if (selector === void 0) { selector = undefined; }\n\t        return function () {\n\t            var args = [];\n\t            for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n\t                args[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n\t            }\n\t            return new BoundNodeCallbackObservable(func, selector, args, this, scheduler);\n\t        };\n\t    };\n\t    BoundNodeCallbackObservable.prototype._subscribe = function (subscriber) {\n\t        var callbackFunc = this.callbackFunc;\n\t        var args = this.args;\n\t        var scheduler = this.scheduler;\n\t        var subject = this.subject;\n\t        if (!scheduler) {\n\t            if (!subject) {\n\t                subject = this.subject = new AsyncSubject_1.AsyncSubject();\n\t                var handler = function handlerFn() {\n\t                    var innerArgs = [];\n\t                    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n\t                        innerArgs[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n\t                    }\n\t                    var source = handlerFn.source;\n\t                    var selector = source.selector, subject = source.subject;\n\t                    var err = innerArgs.shift();\n\t                    if (err) {\n\t                        subject.error(err);\n\t                    }\n\t                    else if (selector) {\n\t                        var result_1 = tryCatch_1.tryCatch(selector).apply(this, innerArgs);\n\t                        if (result_1 === errorObject_1.errorObject) {\n\t                            subject.error(errorObject_1.errorObject.e);\n\t                        }\n\t                        else {\n\t                            subject.next(result_1);\n\t                            subject.complete();\n\t                        }\n\t                    }\n\t                    else {\n\t                        subject.next(innerArgs.length <= 1 ?

If your event target does not match any of the ones listed,\n\t     * you should use {@link fromEventPattern}, which can be used on arbitrary APIs.\n\t     * When it comes to APIs supported by `fromEvent`, their methods for adding and removing event\n\t     * handler functions have different names, but they all accept a string describing event type\n\t     * and function itself, which will be called whenever said event happens.\n\t     *\n\t     * Every time resulting Observable is subscribed, event handler function will be registered\n\t     * to event target on given event type.

In order to get access to them,\n\t     * you can pass to `fromEvent` optional project function, which will be called with all arguments\n\t     * passed to event handler.

When\n\t     * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values\n\t     * as third parameter as well.\n\t     *\n\t     * **Node.js EventEmitter**\n\t     *\n\t     * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.\n\t     *\n\t     * **JQuery-style event target**\n\t     *\n\t     * An object with `on` and `off` methods\n\t     *\n\t     * **DOM NodeList**\n\t     *\n\t     * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.\n\t     *\n\t     * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes\n\t     * it contains and install event handler function in every of them.

So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n\t * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n\t * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n\t * on the first place and so on).\n\t *\n\t * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n\t * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n\t * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n\t * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n\t * completes immediately.\n\t *\n\t * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n\t * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n\t * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n\t * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n\t * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n\t * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n\t * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n\t * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n\t * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n\t * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n\t * value.\n\t *\n\t * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n\t * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n\t * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n\t * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n\t * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n\t * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n\t * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n\t *\n\t * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n\t * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n\t * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n\t * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n\t * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n\t * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n\t * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n\t * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n\t * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n\t * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n\t * // Logs\n\t * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n\t * // [1, 0] after 1s\n\t * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n\t * // [2, 1] after 2s\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n\t * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n\t *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n\t * );\n\t * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n\t * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n\t * // Logs\n\t * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n\t * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n\t * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n\t * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\n\t * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n\t * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n\t * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\n\t * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n\t *\n\t * // With output to console:\n\t * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n\t * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n\t * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @see {@link combineAll}\n\t * @see {@link merge}\n\t * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n\t *\n\t * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n\t * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n\t * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n\t * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n\t * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n\t * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n\t * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n\t * each input Observable.\n\t * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n\t * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n\t * each input Observable.\n\t * @static true\n\t * @name combineLatest\n\t * @owner Observable\n\t */\n\tfunction combineLatest() {\n\t    var observables = [];\n\t    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n\t        observables[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n\t    }\n\t    var project = null;\n\t    var scheduler = null;\n\t    if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n\t        scheduler = observables.pop();\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n\t        project = observables.pop();\n\t    }\n\t    // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n\t    // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], project)`\n\t    if (observables.length === 1 && isArray_1.isArray(observables[0])) {\n\t        observables = observables[0];\n\t    }\n\t    return new ArrayObservable_1.ArrayObservable(observables, scheduler).lift(new combineLatest_1.CombineLatestOperator(project));\n\t}\n\texports.combineLatest = combineLatest;\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=combineLatest.js.map\n\n/***/ },\n/* 336 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tvar DeferObservable_1 = __webpack_require__(318);\n\texports.defer = DeferObservable_1.DeferObservable.create;\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=defer.js.map\n\n/***/ },\n/* 337 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n\t    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n\t    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n\t    d.prototype = b === null ?

As a result you will get a special kind of an Observable - a {@link ConnectableObservable}. It can be\n\t * subscribed multiple times, just as regular Observable, but it won't subscribe to the source Observable at that\n\t * moment. It will do it only if you call its `connect` method. This means you can essentially control by hand, when\n\t * source Observable will be actually subscribed. What is more, ConnectableObservable will share this one subscription\n\t * between all of its subscribers. This means that, for example, `ajax` Observable will only send a request once,\n\t * even though usually it would send a request per every subscriber. Since it sends a request at the moment of\n\t * subscription, here request would be sent when the `connect` method of a ConnectableObservable is called.\n\t *\n\t * The most common pattern of using ConnectableObservable is calling `connect` when the first consumer subscribes,\n\t * keeping the subscription alive while several consumers come and go and finally unsubscribing from the source\n\t * Observable, when the last consumer unsubscribes. To not implement that logic over and over again,\n\t * ConnectableObservable has a special operator, `refCount`. When called, it returns an Observable, which will count\n\t * the number of consumers subscribed to it and keep ConnectableObservable connected as long as there is at least\n\t * one consumer. So if you don't actually need to decide yourself when to connect and disconnect a\n\t * ConnectableObservable, use `refCount`.\n\t *\n\t * The second mode is invoked by calling `multicast` with an additional, second argument - selector function.\n\t * This function accepts an Observable - which basically mirrors the source Observable - and returns Observable\n\t * as well, which should be the input stream modified by any operators you want. Note that in this\n\t * mode you cannot provide initialized Subject as a first argument - it has to be a Subject factory. If\n\t * you provide selector function, `multicast` returns just a regular Observable, instead of ConnectableObservable.\n\t * Thus, as usual, each subscription to this stream triggers subscription to the source Observable. However,\n\t * if inside the selector function you subscribe to the input Observable multiple times, actual source stream\n\t * will be subscribed only once. So if you have a chain of operators that use some Observable many times,\n\t * but you want to subscribe to that Observable only once, this is the mode you would use.\n\t *\n\t * Subject provided as a first parameter of `multicast` is used as a proxy for the single subscription to the\n\t * source Observable. It means that all values from the source stream go through that Subject. Thus, if a Subject\n\t * has some special properties, Observable returned by `multicast` will have them as well.

It\n     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is\n     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling\n     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n     * thought.\n     *\n     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n     * following ways.\n     *\n     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n     * be left uncaught.\n     *\n     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n     *\n     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n     *\n     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n     * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n     * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>\n     * const sumObserver = {\n     *   sum: 0,\n     *   next(value) {\n     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n     *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n     *   },\n     *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,\n     *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n     *   complete() {\n     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n     *   }\n     * };\n     *\n     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n     * .subscribe(sumObserver);\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // \"Adding: 1\"\n     * // \"Adding: 2\"\n     * // \"Adding: 3\"\n     * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Subscribe with functions</caption>\n     * let sum = 0;\n     *\n     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)\n     * .subscribe(\n     *   function(value) {\n     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n     *     sum = sum + value;\n     *   },\n     *   undefined,\n     *   function() {\n     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum);\n     *   }\n     * );\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // \"Adding: 1\"\n     * // \"Adding: 2\"\n     * // \"Adding: 3\"\n     * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Cancel a subscription</caption>\n     * const subscription = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).subscribe(\n     *   num => console.log(num),\n     *   undefined,\n     *   () => console.log('completed!') // Will not be called, even\n     * );                                // when cancelling subscription\n     *\n     *\n     * setTimeout(() => {\n     *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n     *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n     * }, 2500);\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // 0 after 1s\n     * // 1 after 2s\n     * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2.5s\n     *\n     *\n     * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n     *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n     *  Observable.\n     * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.

Passing an empty array will result\n * in Observable that completes immediately.\n *\n * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without\n * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will\n * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be\n * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,\n * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator\n * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out\n * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,\n * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.\n *\n * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete\n * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed.

Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted.

The selector function\n     * takes the same arguments as the callback and returns the value that will be emitted by the Observable.\n     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as an array\n     * the selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as the callback would.\n     * This means you can imagine the default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n     * as a function that aggregates all its arguments into an array, or simply returns first argument\n     * if there is only one.\n     *\n     * The last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when the call\n     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default, the subscription to  an Observable calls `func`\n     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as the last parameter will defer the call to `func`,\n     * just like wrapping the call in `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0` would. If you use the async Scheduler\n     * and call `subscribe` on the output Observable all function calls that are currently executing\n     * will end before `func` is invoked.\n     *\n     * By default results passed to the callback are emitted immediately after `func` invokes the callback.\n     * In particular, if the callback is called synchronously the subscription of the resulting Observable\n     * will call the `next` function synchronously as well.  If you want to defer that call,\n     * you may use `Scheduler.async` just as before.  This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can\n     * ensure that `func` always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n     *\n     * Note that the Observable created by the output function will always emit a single value\n     * and then complete immediately. If `func` calls the callback multiple times, values from subsequent\n     * calls will not appear in the stream. If you need to listen for multiple calls,\n     *  you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n     *\n     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property) and is not already bound the context of `func`\n     * will be the context that the output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n     * is called as a method of some objec and if `func` is not already bound, in order to preserve the context\n     * it is recommended that the context of the output function is set to that object as well.\n     *\n     * If the input function calls its callback in the \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n     * optional error parameter signaling whether the call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions the same as any other and error parameters\n     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\n     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Receive an array of arguments passed to a callback</caption>\n     * someFunction((a, b, c) => {\n     *   console.log(a);

When\n     * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values\n     * as third parameter as well.\n     *\n     * **Node.js EventEmitter**\n     *\n     * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.\n     *\n     * **JQuery-style event target**\n     *\n     * An object with `on` and `off` methods\n     *\n     * **DOM NodeList**\n     *\n     * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.\n     *\n     * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes\n     * it contains and install event handler function in every of them.

This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n * );\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\n * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n *\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @static true\n * @name combineLatest\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction combineLatest() {\n    var observables = [];\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n        observables[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n    }\n    var project = null;\n    var scheduler = null;\n    if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n        scheduler = observables.pop();\n    }\n    if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n        project = observables.pop();\n    }\n    // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n    // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], project)`\n    if (observables.length === 1 && isArray_1.isArray(observables[0])) {\n        observables = observables[0];\n    }\n    return new ArrayObservable_1.ArrayObservable(observables, scheduler).lift(new combineLatest_1.CombineLatestOperator(project));\n}\nexports.combineLatest = combineLatest;\n//# sourceMappingURL=combineLatest.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/combineLatest.js\n// module id = 335\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar DeferObservable_1 = require('./DeferObservable');\nexports.defer = DeferObservable_1.DeferObservable.create;\n//# sourceMappingURL=defer.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/defer.js\n// module id = 336\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?

As a result you will get a special kind of an Observable - a {@link ConnectableObservable}. It can be\n * subscribed multiple times, just as regular Observable, but it won't subscribe to the source Observable at that\n * moment. It will do it only if you call its `connect` method. This means you can essentially control by hand, when\n * source Observable will be actually subscribed. What is more, ConnectableObservable will share this one subscription\n * between all of its subscribers. This means that, for example, `ajax` Observable will only send a request once,\n * even though usually it would send a request per every subscriber. Since it sends a request at the moment of\n * subscription, here request would be sent when the `connect` method of a ConnectableObservable is called.\n *\n * The most common pattern of using ConnectableObservable is calling `connect` when the first consumer subscribes,\n * keeping the subscription alive while several consumers come and go and finally unsubscribing from the source\n * Observable, when the last consumer unsubscribes. To not implement that logic over and over again,\n * ConnectableObservable has a special operator, `refCount`. When called, it returns an Observable, which will count\n * the number of consumers subscribed to it and keep ConnectableObservable connected as long as there is at least\n * one consumer. So if you don't actually need to decide yourself when to connect and disconnect a\n * ConnectableObservable, use `refCount`.\n *\n * The second mode is invoked by calling `multicast` with an additional, second argument - selector function.\n * This function accepts an Observable - which basically mirrors the source Observable - and returns Observable\n * as well, which should be the input stream modified by any operators you want. Note that in this\n * mode you cannot provide initialized Subject as a first argument - it has to be a Subject factory. If\n * you provide selector function, `multicast` returns just a regular Observable, instead of ConnectableObservable.\n * Thus, as usual, each subscription to this stream triggers subscription to the source Observable. However,\n * if inside the selector function you subscribe to the input Observable multiple times, actual source stream\n * will be subscribed only once. So if you have a chain of operators that use some Observable many times,\n * but you want to subscribe to that Observable only once, this is the mode you would use.\n *\n * Subject provided as a first parameter of `multicast` is used as a proxy for the single subscription to the\n * source Observable. It means that all values from the source stream go through that Subject. Thus, if a Subject\n * has some special properties, Observable returned by `multicast` will have them as well. If you want to use\n * `multicast` with a Subject that is one of the ones included in RxJS by default - {@link Subject},\n * {@link AsyncSubject}, {@link BehaviorSubject}, or {@link ReplaySubject} - simply use {@link publish},\n * {@link publishLast}, {@link publishBehavior} or {@link publishReplay} respectively. These are actually\n * just wrappers around `multicast`, with a specific Subject hardcoded inside.\n *\n * Also, if you use {@link publish} or {@link publishReplay} with a ConnectableObservables `refCount` operator,\n * you can simply use {@link share} and {@link shareReplay} respectively, which chain these two.\n *\n * @example <caption>Use ConnectableObservable</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n * const connectableSeconds = seconds.multicast(new Subject());\n *\n * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('first: ' + value));\n * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('second: ' + value));\n *\n * // At this point still nothing happens, even though we subscribed twice.\n *\n * connectableSeconds.connect();\n *\n * // From now on `seconds` are being logged to the console,\n * // twice per every second. `seconds` Observable was however only subscribed once,\n * // so under the hood Observable.interval had only one clock started.\n *\n * @example <caption>Use selector</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n *\n * seconds\n *     .multicast(\n *         () => new Subject(),\n *         seconds => seconds.zip(seconds) // Usually zip would subscribe to `seconds` twice.\n *                                         // Because we are inside selector, `seconds` is subscribed once,\n *     )                                   // thus starting only one clock used internally by Observable.interval.\n *     .subscribe();\n *\n * @see {@link publish}\n * @see {@link publishLast}\n * @see {@link publishBehavior}\n * @see {@link publishReplay}\n * @see {@link share}\n * @see {@link shareReplay}\n *\n * @param {Function|Subject} subjectOrSubjectFactory - Factory function to create an intermediate Subject through\n * which the source sequence's elements will be multicast to the selector function input Observable or\n * ConnectableObservable returned by the operator.\n * @param {Function} [selector] - Optional selector function that can use the input stream\n * as many times as needed, without causing multiple subscriptions to the source stream.\n * Subscribers to the input source will receive all notifications of the source from the\n * time of the subscription forward.\n * @return {Observable<T>|ConnectableObservable<T>} An Observable that emits the results of invoking the selector\n * on the source stream or a special {@link ConnectableObservable}, if selector was not provided.\n *\n * @method multicast\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction multicast(subjectOrSubjectFactory, selector) {\n    return multicast_1.multicast(subjectOrSubjectFactory, selector)(this);\n}\nexports.multicast = multicast;\n//# sourceMappingURL=multicast.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/operator/multicast.js\n// module id = 405\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar observeOn_1 = require('../operators/observeOn');\n/**\n *\n * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>\n *\n * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule\n * notifications emitted by the source Observable.
